**[Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/)** is an independent educational non-profit that works to fight global misconceptions and promote a fact-based worldview using data. The Gapminder dataset contains historical data on economic and social indicators like life expectancy and the GDP per capita of countries over time to offer insights into global development trends.

This website provides analyses of the indicators in the dataset, exploring relationships between life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population to better understand global development patterns.
